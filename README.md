# AdventOfCode

democat's Advent of Code repository.

The repository is organized by year, mostly, with the exception of a half-hearted solution in Rust. The `lib/` folder contains python files essential for Python scripts in the various folders.

To run a python script, navigate to the root folder of this repository and run `python -m <year>.day<num>`, the path to the module file.

VS Code is also setup to run the files with ease. Install the [Command Variable](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rioj7.command-variable) extension, and select the "Python: Module" configuration in the Run and Debug menu on the left. Files should now be runnable with Ctrl-F5 and debuggable with F5.
